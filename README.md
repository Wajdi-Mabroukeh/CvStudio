# Pytorch CV Studio

PytorchCV allows users to easily annotate images using a label system for classification problems, a bounding box for localization, and a polygon tool or freehand selection for segmentation tasks. The software also provide the user the option to import a pretrained model to continue tagging the images/ videos (coming soon) Once your annotations have been made, PytorchCV uses Pytorchâ€™s resources to train a deep learning model.
